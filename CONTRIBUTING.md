# Redocly Contributing Guide

Hi! We're really excited that you're interested in contributing to the Redocly OpenAPI VS Code extension.

You can help us make the extension better by:

- [reporting bugs](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-vs-code/issues/new/choose)
- [sharing ideas for new features](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-vs-code/issues/new/choose)
- [improving the README](./README.md)


To ensure that your contribution is successful, please follow these guidelines:

- Before opening a new issue, try to make sure the same problem or idea hasn't already been reported. You can do that by going to the [Issues page](https://github.com/Redocly/redocly-vs-code/issues) in the repository and using the filter `is:issue` combined with some keywords relevant to your idea or problem. It helps us notice that more people have the same issue or use-case, and reduces the chance of getting your issue marked as a duplicate. Plus, you can even find some workarounds for your issue in the comments of a previously reported one!

- When opening a new issue, you'll use one of the templates (depending on the issue type). The templates lead you through the issue submission process by suggesting what to write in each section. You don't have to fill in all sections in a template if they're not relevant to your issue. Feel free to delete irrelevant sections from your issue before submitting it, or leave them blank.

- The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a (reduced) test case. This means listing and explaining the steps we should take to try and hit the same problem you're having. It helps us understand in which conditions the issue appears, and gives us a better idea of what may be causing it.

- Abide by our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all your interactions on this repository, and show patience and respect to other community members.
